    "Name" : "abc kumar",
    "address" : "xyz",
    "account number" : 12345,
    "Result" : "Rejected",
    "Reason" : "The decision to reject the credit application comes from the applicant's unfavorable financial ratios – a high Debt-to-Income ratio and a low Quick ratio – suggesting potential difficulty in managing additional debt or impending short-term liabilities. However, the credit risk score of the applicant reflects possibility of improvement, and if acted upon, can lead to a reconsideration of the credit application in the future. No fraud risks have been found which can also be a favorable factor once the financial ratios show improvement."
